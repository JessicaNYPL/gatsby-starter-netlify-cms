The closure of physical libraries to support New York's social distancing surfaced 3 immediate needs for the Product team:

1. **Informing and supporting our patrons,** both on library responses to COVID-19 but also guiding them to the resources they need, entertaining or community-based.
2. **Accommodating increased digital engagement.** As the world went digital, 
3. **Creating new digital versions of library programs,** especially the learning and support programs our patrons rely on. 

The Product team has several team members in charge of portfolio groups, and they each share some of their focus in meeting the immediate needs of the Library.

**Accommodating Acceleration**

Risa Wolf is the PM in charge of our e-reading app, SimplyE. The app saw a sharp increase in demand after the temporary closure. 

> _When external demand for a product developed and maintained by the Library expands rapidly, Product has to stretch to accommodate the new demand for access and information_

Risa mentions that in order to 'stretch', PMs must maintain old methods of communication while also expanding into new ones: additional weekly meetings, creating more documentation, repeating statuses across groups to ensure comprehension. Another important key is to repeat repeat repeat. 

**Invigorating Infrastructure**

Lana Vistup is the PM in charge of our digital asset management (DAM) and she has had to support the additional stress on the bandwidth of our infrastructure.

> _As Product we need stakeholder buy-in for upgrading, maintaining and refactoring systems and processes to stabilize our products, reduce emergencies, security concerns and support future initiatives_

Her advice is a cornerstone of product: Stephen Covey’s 4 quadrants to help visualize and prioritize tasks according to importance and urgency.

**Mind Mobile**

Sean Redmond is in charge of our digital research services. With an upcoming public beta launch, Sean shares his experience needing to refocus on mobile use cases after a desktop-first plan.

> _We had focused on the desktop experience, researchers mostly don't research on phones and this seemed like a legitimate use case, but now we have to work in the new reality_

Sean calls out that unforeseen mobile use cases for institutions are generally what causes stress, anxiety, and bugs, while also being the easiest to deprioritize. Now, all of Product's team is keeping a close eye on mobile components.

**Prioritization**

No post about PM would be done without talking about prioritization. In this case, Courtney McGee in charge of our websites tells us about the changing priorities during the closure. 

> _Almost any one thing can be done, but all of the things can’t be, we have to work to offer creative options and viable alternatives, with the amount of effort put in guided by the level of priority of the request_

How to tackle this is similar to Lana's experience: situate requests within matrix of prioritization schemes, for initiatives across the library and deliverability.

**Maintaining Momentum**

Miguel Rayos is a cross-portfolio PM who works on special projects. His longterm projects bring perspectives and he shares more about how to help colleagues during challenging times. 

> _Product can act as a motor to maintain momentum in projects providing stability and continuity._

He shares that the work required to make a project a source of stability is tedious, but well worth the effort: pre-meeting agendas (ahead of time not 30 mins before!), recap emails, shared notes, availability across slack/email/g-chat, and timelines as accountability mechanisms. 

**Finally, Empathy**

The Product team's leader, Jessica want, emphasizes that Product's responsibility is to be empathetic, with patrons, users, coworkers, and ourselves. 

> _Give everyone more room to breathe._



The Product team at NYPL works closely with teams across the library to support everyone in these unprecedented times.
