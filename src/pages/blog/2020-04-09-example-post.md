The closure of physical libraries to support New York's social distancing surfaced 3 immediate needs for the Product team:

1. **Informing and supporting our patrons,** both on library responses to COVID-19 but also guiding them to the resources they need, entertaining or community-based.
2. **Accommodating increased digital engagement.** As the world went digital, 
3. **Creating new digital versions of library programs,** especially the learning and support programs our patrons rely on. 

The Product team has several team members in charge of portfolio groups, and they each share some of their focus in meeting the immediate needs of the Library.

**Accommodating Acceleration**

Risa Wolf is the PM in charge of our e-reading app, SimplyE. The app saw a sharp increase in demand after the temporary closure. 

> _When external demand for a product developed and maintained by the Library expands rapidly, Product has to stretch to accommodate the new demand for access and information_

Risa mentions that in order to 'stretch', PMs must maintain old methods of communication while also expanding into new ones: additional weekly meetings, creating more documentation, repeating statuses across groups to ensure comprehension. Another important key is to repeat repeat repeat. 

**Invigorating Infrastructure**

Lana Vistup is the PM in charge of our digital asset management (DAM) and she has had to support the additional stress on the bandwidth of our infrastructure.

> _As Product we need stakeholder buy-in for upgrading, maintaining and refactoring systems and processes to stabilize our products, reduce emergencies, security concerns and support future initiatives_

Her advice is a cornerstone of product: Stephen Coveyâ€™s 4 quadrants to help visualize and prioritize tasks according to importance and urgency.
