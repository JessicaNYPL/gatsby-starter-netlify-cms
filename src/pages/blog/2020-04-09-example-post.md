The closure of physical libraries to support New York's social distancing surfaced 3 immediate needs for the Product team:

1. **Informing and supporting our patrons,** both on library responses to COVID-19 but also guiding them to the resources they need, entertaining or community-based.
2. **Accommodating increased digital engagement.** As the world went digital, 
3. **Creating new digital versions of library programs,** especially the learning and support programs our patrons rely on. 

The Product team has several team members in charge of portfolio groups, and they each share some of their focus in meeting the immediate needs of the Library.
